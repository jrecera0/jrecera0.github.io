    - WPILib
    - Which Libraries to Install
    - Which other applications to install (NI Game Tools, etc. DO NOT OVEREXPLAIN, POINT TO WPI DOCS)
        - Brew Login: dbrewcyznski@d230.org; PW: EagleArmy3488
        - Ask Brew for Serial every year, it changes
    - Where do I go if I don't know how to code? (Codecademy, Brew's class, whatever else we can find, youtube videos / series)
    - Barebones explanation of how to use VSCode w/WPILib extension (common hotkeys, directions, etc)
    - Basic Hardware overview (electronics, radio, etc)
    - How to import other libraries
    
- "Breakdown of Project Layout / Organization"
    - General coding / organization practices (keep Driver Station offline, windows 10 gae)
    - What the heck are each of the folders in here, what are subsystems, commands, etc
    - Explanation of project types / what projects are there?
    - Code Snippet examples (basic command, subsystem, etc)

- "Maintainance / good practices / Tips"
    - Practices for keeping stuff updated / firmware
    - Weird small tidbits
        - "RioLog is broken, idk why"
        - "The password to the WSL install is ' ' (this is not a typo)"
        - "Use "WARNING! " if you want your text to appear in the driver statiom
        - DO NOT OVERLOAD WITH PRINT STATEMENTS, WE CRASHED THE ROBOT ONCE

- "Autonomous"
    - PathWeaver / Path Creation
        - Quirks (translate path to 0,0 of robot)
    - Mecanum (necessity because lack of documentation)
    - West Coast
    - Characterization (hopefully no more weird python version install thing)
    - Odometry
    - Basic workflow to go from nothing to self-driving robot
    - Constructing autonomous commands (including subsystems, paths, etc)

- "Computer Vision"
    - Limelight (multiple uses beyond GREEN)
        - IP Addressing: Switch from static to dynamic. Or reflash. Or Angry IP Scanner.
        - tldr ip address dumb
    - Rasp Pi + Basic OpenCV
    - GRIP
    - *Integration Hell*
    - NetworkTables
    - (might be fun to pursue) YOLO models >:3

- "PID Control"
    - Using Phoenix Tuner
    - Using... math

- "Basic Tutorials"
    - Blank projects to basic working drive train
        - Tank
        - Mecanum
    - Working drive train to autonomous ready code
        - Kinematics, odometry, etc
        - Tank and mecanum
    - Basic Subsystem code
        - Timer
        - Command
    - Basic Command based project
        - Mainly point of comparison between timer vs command
    - Basic Computer Vision
        - Aka how to pull from network tables
    - Basics for adding data to shuffleboard
    - Basic PID project
        - Both pos and velocity

- "Driving / Controller Layout"
    - How to not drive badly
    - How to not be designated driver
    - How to not freak out on the field
    - How to not make a shitty control scheme
    - Splitting to two controllers
    - **Field Oriented Drive**

- "Resources"
    - (Dup) Where do I go if I don't know how to code? (Codecademy, Brew's class, whatever else we can find, youtube videos / series)

---
- "Shuffleboard"
    - DO NOT HARDCODE ANYTHING, autopopulation gae
- "Electronics Basics"
    - because for some reason we don't have a dedicated electronics team
- "Leadership / Good Practices? Organization, Program Testing, etc"
- "Random tidbits"
