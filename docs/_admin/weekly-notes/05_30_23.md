# Notes from 05/30/23 Discord Call

## Overarcing Goals
- *Focus: Assume that the reader has little to no experience*
    - Assume there's going to be a lot of newbies
    - Don't just lecture, actually try and teach in such a way that's useful. Less regurgitation of technical information, and moreso guidance.
        - Link to pages
- Explained well
- Visuals, diagrams
- User-Friendly; Teaching to a toddler
    - Gives enough detail but doesn't drown with TOO much information. Too much pushes people away.
    - Concise, straight and to the point
- How to differentiate from FRC Docs:
    - FRC Docs are missing SHORT good bit code examples. Need more code samples that are fully commented and explained, could help people grasp things better in documentation. Ties back to visuals and giving more information.
    - More technical: Give more background to mecanum auton, or auton in general because FRC docs are a little broad
- Background on more technical stuff individual, such as trajectories, computer vision, etc
    - Yearly code breakdown (2019 - 2023)
    - (More like a nice to have thingy)
- Don't be racist in the robotics documentation


## Timeframe / Organization
- Finished Product: Mid August (James moves in August 12th)
- Milestones:
    - Weekly Goals?
    - Trello
- Determine timeline

## TODO
- Create list of general categories / sections / topics
    - Larger sections (basics, environment setup, general maintaince / firmware, etc)
