# Categories (tentative)
These are the current categories we will try to write with each subcategory / page that we have to write out.

## Getting Started
- Home Page (James)
- WPILib (Gwen)
    - What is this?
    - Installation
    - Basic Usage
        - How to use WPILib extension, how to use VSCode, hotkeys, directions, etc.
    - Good Practices
        - (info for Driver Station installation vs computers being used for programming)
- Libraries (Gwen)
    - Should include installation for the key ones we use, alongside how to import other libraries that may need to be used
- Other Key Applications (James)
- ~~Basic Hardware (Logan)~~
- ~~Resources for Absolute Beginners (Technically All, James + Gwen?)~~ (I don't know if there's enough time to find these resources)

## Project Organization (need to refine)
- Robot Code Organization (Where's which file, etc)
- Project Types and Organization (wtf is a command based, what's a subsystem, etc)
- ~~Coding Conventions~~ (...let's touch on this if possible but, it's nonessential for now)
- ~~Developing as a Team~~
- ~~Basic Examples~~

## Autonomous (KEY)
- Path Creation and PathWeaver
    - Be sure to include various quirks such as translating paths later on to the (0, 0) of the robot itself!
- Code Setup for Mecanum
- Code Setup for West Coast
- Characterization
- Odometry
- Kinematics
    - (? Might not need this section)
- 0 to Autonomous Workflow

    - Including paths, subsystems, etc, parallel commands, all that fun stuff

## Computer Vision
- ~~Limelight (and its quirks)~~
- ~~Raspberry Pi / Co-Processors~~
- ~~OpenCV~~
- ~~GRIP~~
- ~~NetworkTables~~
- Notes from James
    - Basically this needs to be heavily abbreviated. Can use the above topics, just can't have it become lengthy

## Basic Tutorials / Code Examples (KEY)
- PID
  - What is PID

- Guidelines for Two Controller Layouts
- ~~Former Driver Q&A~~

## Maintainance (Keep it to an overview of firmware and updates)
- ~~Good Driver Station Practices~~
- RoboRIO Firmware
- Radio Firmware
- Motor Firmware
- WPILib Updates
- Library Updates
- ~~Misc. Notes and Guidelines~~

## Yearly Code (Keeping it to the most revent years)

# ~~Extra Categories~~
~~These are extra categories that we brainstormed that might be good to have but that we will only touch if we have extra time.~~

- ~~Shuffleboard~~
- ~~Electronics Basics~~
- ~~Leadership / Good Practices~~ 
- ~~Random Tidbits / Quirks~~
