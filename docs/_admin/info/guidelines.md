# Guidelines for writing
- Do your best to keep writing cohesive between each section. If writing between each section doesn't necessarily flow that well, it won't be the end of the world, but at a minimum make sure that someone can read through it and understand whatever it is that is being explained.
- Remember your audience! You are writing for someone with little to no experience with programming, similar to when you were freshmen. Assume the person reading this documentation knows nothing, but don't overexplain either.
- Avoid using first person pronouns (I, we, etc). In general, don't write in a weird POV.
- Be concise and do not overexplain. There are more detailed documents out there people can refer to if they truly want to get into the nitty gritty with details on how stuff really works.
- If something is already well enough explained in a different piece of documentation, e.g. the FRC Docs or there's a decent example with CTRE, point to those resources. No need to be redudant with what already exists, and there's no need to improve on pieces of documentation that are already well written.
- Be inclusive!
- If you're a little stuck- think about what would've helped you as a freshman. Would reading what you are currently writing only confuse you more, or is it actually clear and insightful information that is helping you learn a lot quicker about FRC Programming?
