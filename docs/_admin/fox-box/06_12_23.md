# Pre-Meeting Notes

## Agenda (tentative)
- How was writing for everyone? Do we need to actually make a better workflow for ourselves or not, I know I sorta just threw everyone into, well, writing. Which was probably less than ideal.
- Review `Getting-Started` and written sections
- Feedback for each other and ourselves?
- Which section to work on next? Look at categories, what should we add, remove, etc, can we shift anything around in terms of where we're putting what info-
- PROPER assignment of sections to each person so that we know who's writing what.
- I will be out the week of June 26; can decide what we will do about this next week

## Bleh version of plan
- See how far everyone got, adapt meeting from there. If getting started is finished, review and see if we need more time to write. If getting started looks okay, then we move to a new section. If getting started isn't finished, then we continue to work on it (and maybe tack on this week's work too)
