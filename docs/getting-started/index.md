# Getting Started

Ready to get started with programming and developing code for the robot? This is the place to start! As a brief overview, this section will walk you through the installation of important applications such as [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/) and [CTRE](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/software/), and after installation we will walk you through the basics of hardware you can expect yourself to be working with.

Feel free to check out [Additional Resources](/_assets/placeholder.png) for more info on getting started, and whenever you're ready, feel free to move on to [WPILib](/_assets/placeholder.png) to get started on installation.

### A Personal Note:
Setup is one of those things that you don't really think is going to be that bad, but in the case of development for FRC, there is quite a bit of software to go through, install, learn and get a feel for. It seems like a lot, but we promise you, once you get the hang of things! Installing each required application will become a breeze and you'll learn what each tool is used for.
